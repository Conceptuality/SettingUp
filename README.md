# SettingUp
"Hello, Welcome to my first GitHub Repository!" -x-x-x- This repository is a setting up guide to anyone new to Git and GitHub. I will be documenting the things that I felt were needed for setting up a good GitHub profile and start using Git. This would just be the basics and from here on I will have different repositories based on how the genre changes and need be for the same. -x-x-x- "Cheers!"
