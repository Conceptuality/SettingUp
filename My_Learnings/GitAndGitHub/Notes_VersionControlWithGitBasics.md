# Introduction
- When we work on a project, one of our biggest fears is to lose our work.
- Hence we constantly save our files, and making backup copies. 
- When I was starting out, I would manually make these copies by adding the date, a version number, or a short descriptor to the end of the file name. 
- But managing these different versions was just turning me into a digital pack rat. I had all these different files that were just taking up space. I didn't want to delete them just in case I needed them again. 
- And if you've ever created a file called Version One, Version Two, or Final Version Three, then you know this method can be hard to manage. 
- And if something were to happen to the hard drive, I would lose all of those carefully crafted files. 
- But then, I discovered version control systems, which are tools that are designed to handle this for us. 
- In this notes we learn to use Git to streamline your work flow, starting from installing and configuring Git, the overall concepts and terminology, adding and tracking changes, and managing your project files. 
- By the end of this study, my hope is that you'll feel comfortable with the Git work flow, and excited to start using it in your projects, and never again have to deal with a file named "Final Version Three". 
- Let's get started. <br/>
