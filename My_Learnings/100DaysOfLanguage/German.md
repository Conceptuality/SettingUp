'''
	In German - unlike English, though very much like most other languages - verbs change their endings depending on who's doing the verb. The verb "to drink" in German is "trinken", but when you want to say "I drink" or "he drinks" you have to change the end of the verb:

	Ich trinke = I drink
	Du trinkst = you drink
	Er/sie/es trinkt = he/she/it drinks
	Wir trinken = we drink
	Ihr trinkt = you (plural) drink
	Sie trinken = they (or the formal "you") drink

	In German, most verbs conjugate this way, though the verb "haben" is slightly irregular, and conjugates as so:

	Ich habe = I have
	Du hast = you have
	Er/sie/es hat = he/she/it has
	Wir haben = we have
	Ihr habt = you (plural) have
	Sie haben = they (or the formal "you") drink

	Just keep in mind that most verbs in German conjugate more like "trinken" than "haben."

'''
	It all depends on the subject. 
	If the subject is ich (I), use trinke. 
	Subject is du (the informal singular you), trinkst. 
	Er, sie, es, ihr (he, she, it, informal plural you) trinkt. 
	Sie, sie, wir (formal you, they, we) trinken. 
	And if you don't have a pronoun in a sentence you use the conjugation of the pronoun you could have used. 
		For example, “Hannah is drinking the water.” is “Hannah trinkt das Wasser.” in German because Hannah could have been replaced with sie (she) and thus uses trinkt just like sie (she) does. 
		When you say “The women drink beer.” it's “Die Frauen trinken Bier.” because Die Frauen could have been replaced with sie (they). 
		Finally, “Margerette and I drink together.” is “Margarette und ich trinken zusammen.” Notice that although ich is part of the subject, it's not trinke but trinken because Margerette und ich is the full subject. And that full subject could be replaced with wir (we) and thus uses trinken.
